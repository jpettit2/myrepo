A line I wrote on my local computer
Looks like I use echo to print something to  file (at least the read me) but need to be sure to use >> file name to tell it what to add it to.
git tells me I am talking to git, then comes a verb i.e. in order to add to a readme (at least) use add -A after the echo command, then use git commit -m and add a quoted decritpion of the commit here then use hit push to push it to git hub
